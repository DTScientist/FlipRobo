Hi There, This is Ankush Rao, and I recently signed up for this Data Science and ML PG program from Data Trained.
Sorry, for doing this, but I wanted to create a group of who all students are there studying with these guys and can make a positive collaboration.
I have actually asked these peeps to at least create a whats app kind of group or at least enable public chats while sessions are going on. 
But they simply denied it giving very vague reasons. QUite strange as almost every other institute believes in a "collaborative study approach".

Looks like you are a bit tenured student here, so can you help me create a small group where each one of us can collaborate in a better way?

If yes, please buzz me on what's app - 8178420565
